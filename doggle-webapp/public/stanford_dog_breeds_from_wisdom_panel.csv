Dhole,About 36 in,26–44 lb,About 10 yr,Dholes,"Dholes, wild dogs native to Asia, are lean and lithe canines about the size of a German shepherd.

These predators have auburn fur, a black tail, amber eyes, and upright, rounded ears. Dholes–pronounced ""DOLES""–are most genetically similar to African wild dogs.

Dholes live primarily in fragmented populations in southern and eastern Asia, and can adapt to many different landscapes, including forests, shrublands, and high mountain steppes. They den underground, sometimes repurposing old burrows left behind by hyenas or other animals.

The canines are very social, living in packs of various sizes, even as small as two. One study on pack size in India, which has the highest dhole population, reported that dhole packs were smaller–around six individuals–where tigers were more abundant, and larger–about 17 animals–where tigers were fewer. This suggests competition with tigers for prey keeps dhole packs smaller.

African Wild Dog,29.5–43 in,39.5–79 lb,Up to 10 yr,African Wild Dogs,"The African wild dog is known by many names, including Cape hunting dog or painted dog. Its scientific name, Lycaon pictus, means ""painted wolf"", referring to the animal's irregular, mottled coat, which features patches of red, black, brown, white, and yellow fur. Each animal has its own unique coat pattern, and all have big, rounded ears.

These long-legged canines have only four toes per foot, unlike other dogs, which have five toes on their forefeet.",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/african-wild-dog,https://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Wild_Dog_Side_Profile.png
